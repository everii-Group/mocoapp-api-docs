# MOCO API Documentation

This is the official API documentation for [mocoapp.com](https://www.mocoapp.com) (👉 [we are hiring](https://www.mocoapp.com/unternehmen/jobs)).

## General

- Request payloads to MOCO must be sent as valid JSON with a mandatory `Content-Type: application/json`-header. Responses are also sent as JSON.
- All requests have to be [authenticated](authentication) with a user-specific key or global API key
- Example responses showcase the happy case, i.e. usually the `200 OK` response
- Collections are usually [paginated](#pagination)
- Zapier triggers are **not** triggered for API requests
- Timestamps `created_at` and `updated_at` are sent for all entities in UTC, as ISO8601 format.
- For synchronization almost all resources can be filtered by `updated_after` passing a time in UTC, as ISO8601 format.
- MOCO does not support any client-libraries at the moment. However, there are currently the following unofficial clients available, which you can use at your risk: [Python Client](https://github.com/sommalia/moco-wrapper)

## Entities

All the entities exposed via the API can be found in their [respective sections](entities.md)

## Client Implementations / API Wrappers

Here's a list of API client implementations, not maintained by us. Feel free to open up a PR to point to your implementation so others can re-use it.

| Language |                Repository                |

## Impersonation

By default all requests are scoped to the authenticated user. Some resources cannot be written in behalf of other users like `Activities` and `User Presences`. This reflects the behaviour in the UI. But you can login as another user provided that the authenticated user has permission to _Staff_. To achieve the same behaviour in the API, one can set the following x-header:

`X-IMPERSONATE-USER-ID=123` (user id to act in behalf of)

## Rate Limiting

You can expect to be able to fire 15 requests within a time frame of 15 seconds. If you exceed this limit, the server responds with `429 Too Many Requests`.

## Pagination

Responses are paginated with a common default of 100 entries per page. In the HTTP response header, the current page, the entries per page and the number of total entries is reported. There is also a link header to links to the consecutive page.

- **X-Page** – 3
- **X-Per-Page** – 100
- **X-Total** – 415
- **Link** – `<https://{domain}.mocoapp.com/api/v1/projects.json?page=4>; rel="next"`

If there is not Link header with `rel="next"`, the current page is the last page.

## Errors and HTTP status codes

The MOCO-API is mostly conformant with the [general HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).

Here are the most comment errors you will see:

- **401 Unauthorized** - Check the error message in the response body
- **403 Forbidden** - Check your [Authentication](#authentication) or your MOCO user permission
- **404 Not Found** - Check that resource exists (maybe it was deleted in the meantime)
- **422 Unprocessable Entity** - Check the provided error message in the response body
- **429 Too Many Requests** - Check [Rate Limiting](#rate-limiting)

## Sorting

Sorting is controlled by the `sort_by` query parameter. Its value is the field name that should be sorted, followed by an optional sorting order (`asc` or `desc`, default is `asc`).

Example:

- `https://{domain}.mocoapp.com/api/v1/offers?sort_by=title desc`
