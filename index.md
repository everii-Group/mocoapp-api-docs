## General

- Request payloads to MOCO must be sent as valid JSON with a mandatory `Content-Type: application/json`-header. Responses are also sent as JSON.
- All requests have to be [authenticated](#authentication) with a user-specific key
- Example responses showcase the happy case, i.e. usually the `200 OK` response
- Collections are usually [paginated](#pagination)
- Zapier triggers are **not** triggered for API requests
- Timestamps `created_at` and `updated_at` are sent for all entities in UTC, as ISO8601 format.
- For synchronization almost all resources can be filtered by `updated_after` passing a time in UTC, as ISO8601 format.
- MOCO does not support any client-libraries at the moment. However, there are currently the following unofficial clients available, which you can use at your risk: [Python Client](https://github.com/sommalia/moco-wrapper)

## Authentication

You need an API key for authentication. Each user can find their user-specific key on mocoapp.com on their profile in the "Integrations" tab. This key is provided as an Authorization header.

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'https://{domain}.mocoapp.com/api/v1/projects.json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Token token=YOUR_API_KEY'
```

This key can also be requested via API:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://{domain}.mocoapp.com/api/v1/session \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "email": "max@muster.de",
    "password": "secret"
  }'
```

It's also possible to verify if the API key is still valid:

```bash
curl https://{domain}.mocoapp.com/api/v1/session \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

If the key is valid, the response code id `200 ok` and the body is:

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "uuid": "aec324a2-4832-11eb-b378-0242ac130002"
}
```

otherwise the response code is `401 unauthorized`.

## Postman example

There are a few tools to try out the MOCO API. All the examples in this documentation use `curl` to demonstrate the API endpoint.
A popular graphical UI for REST is [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). Here's an example request for the projects list including the authentication:

![Postman example request](moco-api-postman.png "Postman example request")

## Client Implementations / API Wrappers

Here's a list of API client implementations, not maintained by us. Feel free to open up a PR to point to your implementation so others can re-use it.

| Language |                Repository                |
| -------- | :--------------------------------------: |
| Python   | https://github.com/sommalia/moco-wrapper |

## Impersonation

By default all requests are scoped to the authenticated user. Some resources cannot be written in behalf of other users like `Activities` and `User Presences`. This reflects the behaviour in the UI. But you can login as another user provided that the authenticated user has permission to _Staff_. To achieve the same behaviour in the API, one can set the following x-header:

`X-IMPERSONATE-USER-ID=123` (user id to act in behalf of)

## Rate Limiting

You can expect to be able to fire 15 requests within a time frame of 15 seconds. If you exceed this limit, the server responds with `429 Too Many Requests`.

## Pagination

Responses are paginated with a common default of 100 entries per page. In the HTTP response header, the current page, the entries per page and the number of total entries is reported. There is also a link header to links to the consecutive page.

- **X-Page** â€“ 3
- **X-Per-Page** â€“ 100
- **X-Total** â€“ 415
- **Link** â€“ `<https://{domain}.mocoapp.com/api/v1/projects.json?page=4>; rel="next"`

If there is not Link header with `rel="next"`, the current page is the last page.

## Errors and HTTP status codes

The MOCO-API is mostly conformant with the [general HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).

Here are the most comment errors you will see:

- **401 Unauthorized** - Check the error message in the response body
- **403 Forbidden** - Check your [Authentication](#authentication) or your MOCO user permission
- **404 Not Found** - Check that resource exists (maybe it was deleted in the meantime)
- **422 Unprocessable Entity** - Check the provided error message in the response body
- **429 Too Many Requests** - Check [Rate Limiting](#rate-limiting)

## Sorting

Sorting is controlled by the `sort_by` query parameter. Its value is the field name that should be sorted, followed by an optional sorting order (`asc` or `desc`, default is `asc`).

Example:

- `https://{domain}.mocoapp.com/api/v1/offers?sort_by=title desc`

## Custom Fields

MOCO supports adding custom fields to many of its resources. These custom fields are readable and writable via the `custom_properties` field.

```json
"custom_properties": {
    "UID": "123-UID-456",
    "Line of business": "Automotive"
},
```

Parameters are sent with their name as key:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://{domain}.mocoapp.com/api/v1/customers \
  -H 'Authorization: Token token=YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "Beispiel AG",
    "currency": "CHF",
    "custom_properties": {
      "Line of business": "Automotive"
    }
  }'
```

All values are encoded as strings, expect for Multiple Choice, which is encoded as an array.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://{domain}.mocoapp.com/api/v1/customers \
  -H 'Authorization: Token token=YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "custom_properties": {
          "Line of business": ["Automotive", "Banking"]
        }
      }'
```

- Single-line input â€“ "Automotive"
- Mehrzeilige Eingabe â€“ "A multiline input..."
- Link â€“ "https://www..."
- Date â€“ "2021-12-31"
- Yes/No â€“ "0", "1" (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Single choice â€“ "Value"
- Multiple choice â€“ ["Value 1", "Value 2"]

âš¡ **WARNING** âš¡: If you use custom fields, all of them have to be provided. If not, any that are not transmitted will be removed.
